# Hashcode 2021 by Mental In-laws

We managed to collect 7,363,391 points and get 5125th place. But this isn't true, as I (Ckrielle) didn't submit file D properly, and because of
this we didn't get 1,587,319 points, which would have placed us at 2504 place worldwide, 25th at our country (Greece), and 2nd in our hub. We are but simple freshmen, so 
this sounds incredible, and it's sad it's not real because of a stupid mistake. Even though a better rank would have been nice however, we are proud of us and know what 
we accomplished. Till next year

P.S. I wish for hash.py to remain as is simply for its meme value
