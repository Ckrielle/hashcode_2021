Unironically we got it. We managed to collect 7,363,391 points and get 5125th place. But this isn't true, as I (Ckrielle) didn't submit file D properly, and because of
this we didn't get 1,587,319 points, which would have placed us at 2504 place worldwide. We are but simple freshmen, so this prospect sounds incredible, and it's sad
we didn't get it because of a stupid mistake. We are still however proud of what we did for many reasons, and above all enjoyed ourselves. Till next year

P.S. I wish for hash.py to remain as is simply for its meme value
