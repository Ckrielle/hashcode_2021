# Hashcode 2021 by Mental In-laws

We managed to collect 7,363,391 points and get 5125th place. But this isn't true, as I (Ckrielle) didn't submit file D properly, and because of
this we didn't get 1,587,319 points, which would have placed us at 2504 place worldwide. We are but simple freshmen, so this prospect sounds incredible, and it's sad
we didn't get it because of a stupid mistake. Even though a better number would have been nice, we are proud of us and know what we accomplished. Till next year

P.S. I wish for hash.py to remain as is simply for its meme value
